Each run was 5 minutes long with 500 millisecond sampling.

Normal Scenario:
Tank starts empty. Tank begins to fill with fill valve velocity 6. 
When tank reaches level 7, fill valve velocity remains 6 and discharge valve velocity becomes 6.
After the first 4 rounds, the fill valve velocity decreases, imitating a leak.

Normal 1: Fill Valve Velocity = 6
Normal 2: Fill Valve Velocity = 6
Normal 3: Fill Valve Velocity = 6
Normal 4: Fill Valve Velocity = 6
Normal 5: Fill Valve Velocity = 5.8
Normal 6: Fill Valve Velocity = 5.7
Normal 7: Fill Valve Velocity = 5.6
Normal 8: Fill Valve Velocity = 5.4
Normal 9: Fill Valve Velocity = 5.3
Normal 10: Fill Valve Velocity = 5.0

Compromised Scenario:
Tank starts empty. Tank begins to fill with fill valve velocity 6.
When it reaches level 7, fill valve velocity remains 6 and discharge valve velocity becomes 6.
After the first 4 rounds, the fill valve velocity increases, imitating an attacker trying to cause an overflow.


Normal 1: Fill Valve Velocity = 6
Normal 2: Fill Valve Velocity = 6
Normal 3: Fill Valve Velocity = 6
Normal 4: Fill Valve Velocity = 6
Normal 5: Fill Valve Velocity = 6.4
Normal 6: Fill Valve Velocity = 6.8
Normal 7: Fill Valve Velocity = 7.2
Normal 8: Fill Valve Velocity = 7.6
Normal 9: Fill Valve Velocity = 8.0
Normal 10: Fill Valve Velocity = 8.4
